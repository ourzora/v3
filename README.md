# V3 ð“€¨

This repository contains the core contracts that compose the ZORA V3 Protocol.

This protocol is a [Hyperstructure](https://www.jacob.energy/hyperstructures.html). It is unstoppable, free, expansive, permissionless, and credibly neutral.

Documentation is available at [docs.zora.co](https://docs.zora.co)

ZORA V3 has many market modules, which are individual containers a user can opt in to. All of these modules share the same approval space, and as such can save ZORA users gas in the long term by not requiring new ERC-20 and ERC-721 approvals for every market.

When a new market is registered, a ZORA Module Fee Switch NFT, or ZORF, is minted to the DAO. This fee switch is set to 0 by default. At any time, the holder of the NFT can choose to set a fee, which provides an income stream to the holder on all future transactions in that module.

Once registered, anyone is able to use the market module by approving it via the ZoraModuleManager.

## Contributing

ZORA V3 is meant to be as extensible as possible. As such, there are a number of ways for developers to contribute. This protocol is being developed in the open, and anyone can propose a module, audit a module, or suggest new module types for the community to begin using.

As the protocol matures, so too will these contribution guidelines. If you have a suggestion on how we can collaborate better on this protocol, [please let us know](#leaving-feedback).

### Registering a New Module

New modules are added to V3 in three stages. We track which stage each module is in with PR labels:

- Draft / RFC
- Community Audit
- Ready for Deployment

Note that we also include a 4th label, "ZORA Bug Bounty" for Modules that are created by the ZORA core team and ready for a community audit.

#### Draft / RFC

In this stage, the ZORA community is able to give design feedback and start discussions about what the module aims to accomplish. A new draft module can be started by [creating a new pull request](https://github.com/ourzora/v3/compare).

#### Community Audit

Once a module has been designed, built, tested and documented, the module can undergo community audits. If a vulnerability is found during this phase, feel free to leave a comment directly in the PR. If the module has been audited by a third party, the audit report can be included in the PR.

Modules that are written by the ZORA core team are open to our bug bounty program, which allows community auditors to claim up to 25 ETH for vulnerabilities that may have been missed during development. The rubric we use to determine bug bounties is inspired by [ImmuneFi](https://immunefi.com/severity-updated/) and is as follows:

| **Level**   | **Example**                                                                                                                                                             | **Maximum Bug Bounty** |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| 5. Critical | - Empty or freeze the protocol's holdings (e.g. economic attacks, flash loans, reentrancy, MEV, logic errors)                                                           | Up to 25 ETH           |
| 4. High     | - Token holders temporarily unable to transfer holdings<br>- Users spoof each other<br>- Transient Consensus Failures                                                   | Up to 10 ETH           |
| 3. Medium   | - Contract consumes unbounded gas<br>- Block stuffing<br>- Griefing denial of service (i.e. attacker spends as much in gas as damage to the contract)<br>- Gas griefing | Up to 5 ETH            |
| 2. Low      | - Contract fails to deliver promised returns, but doesn't lose value                                                                                                    | Up to 1 ETH            |
| 1. None     | - Best practices                                                                                                                                                        |                        |
| Not sure?   |                                                                                                                                                                         | Let's talk :~)         |

The ZORA Core team will commit to publicly disclosing all bug bounty payouts for applicable modules, as defined above.

Although not required, developers outside the ZORA core team are able to create and fund their own bug bounty programs, if desired. Feel free to outline your audit program in your PR description.

After a module has undergone a community audit (ideally about 3-7 days), the module can be deployed and registered. If a vulnerability is found post-deployment, you can email [t@zora.co](mailto:t@zora.co) directly.

#### Registering a Module

Since the ZORA DAO is currently controlled by a multi-sig, the ZORA Core team will deploy and register audited modules manually. If the module is marked with a "Ready for Deployment" label, it will be picked up in the next available deployment window by the ZORA core team. Once deployed, the contract address will be available in the `addresses/` directory.

### Leaving Feedback

If you have suggestions or comments on how we can better collaborate on this codebase and/or the protocol as a whole, please [create an issue](https://github.com/ourzora/v3/issues/new) outlining your ideas and suggestions. We can then use the issue tracker as an open discussion forum.

## Local Development

1. Install [Foundry](https://github.com/gakonst/foundry#installation)
2. Install dependencies with `yarn` & `forge update`
3. Compile the contracts with `yarn build`
4. Run tests with `yarn test`

Want [Typechain](https://github.com/dethcrypto/TypeChain) types for Zora's v3 contracts? Install typechain (`yarn add -D typechain @typechain/ethers-v5`) and then add the following step to your project's build process: `yarn typechain --target=ethers-v5 './node_modules/@zoralabs/v3/dist/artifacts/*/*.json' --out-dir zora-v3-types`
